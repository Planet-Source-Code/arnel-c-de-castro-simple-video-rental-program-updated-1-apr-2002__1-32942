</div>

### Description

This video rental program with printing capabilities and Flexgrid to Excel feature is usefull for stand-alone PC. This is my first database programming experience in visual basic 6.0 Service Pack 5. So please bear with my coding techniques. Here you will learn how to use ADO and DAO to access a Password Protected database and how to use SQL techniques.

Some of the snippets were also taken from PSC submissions.

If you like my program please vote for it.

I would appreciate any suggestions or comments.

However i may not be able to answer emails since i'm busy most of the time.

Thnx!
